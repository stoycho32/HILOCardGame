This is information document on how to play the game and use the interface:
Once you start the game, a menu with 3 options will be visible.
The first option is to start the game.

Option 1:
Once you click 1, the game will start and you will need to start guessing the cards.
If you would like to choose a lower card, you will need to write "l"
If you would like to choose a higher card, you will need to write "h"
In order to exist from the game and return to the main screen, you will need to write "e"

Option 2:
You can check your bet history by selecting the second option.
Every bet will have a unique Id.

Option 3:
The third option is to search a bet by Id. If you would like to check a bet later, you can copy
the bet Id  from the bet history and enter it after opening the third option.

Option 4:
Option 4 just stops the program, nothing special.

ENJOY! :~)
